// This is the precomputed constant time access table for the code in
// p256-x86_64.c, for the default generator. The table consists of 37
// subtables, each subtable contains 64 affine points. The affine points are
// encoded as eight uint64's, four for the x coordinate and four for the y.
// Both values are in little-endian order. There are 37 tables because a
// signed, 6-bit wNAF form of the scalar is used and ceil(256/(6 + 1)) = 37.
// Within each table there are 64 values because the 6-bit wNAF value can take
// 64 values, ignoring the sign bit, which is implemented by performing a
// negation of the affine point when required. We would like to align it to 2MB
// in order to increase the chances of using a large page but that appears to
// lead to invalid ELF files being produced.

// This file is generated by make_p256-x86_64-table.go.
