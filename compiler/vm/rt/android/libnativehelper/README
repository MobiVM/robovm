Support functions for Android's class libraries


These are VM-agnostic native functions that implement methods for system
class libraries.  All code here:

 - MUST not be associated with an android.* class (that code lives in
   frameworks/base/).
 - SHOULD be written in C rather than C++ where possible.

Some helper functions are defined in include/nativehelper/JNIHelp.h.
