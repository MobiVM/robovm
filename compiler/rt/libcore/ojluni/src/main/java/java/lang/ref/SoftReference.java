// Android-changed: Javadoc change to recommend against using SoftReferences for caches.
/**
 * Soft reference objects, which are cleared at the discretion of the garbage
 * collector in response to memory demand.
 *
 * <p> Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
 * that an object is <a href="package-summary.html#reachability">softly
 * reachable</a>.  At that time it may choose to clear atomically all soft
 * references to that object and all soft references to any other
 * softly-reachable objects from which that object is reachable through a chain
 * of strong references.  At the same time or at some later time it will
 * enqueue those newly-cleared soft references that are registered with
 * reference queues.
 *
 * <p> All soft references to softly-reachable objects are guaranteed to have
 * been cleared before the virtual machine throws an
 * <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>.  Otherwise no constraints are placed upon the
 * time at which a soft reference will be cleared or the order in which a set
 * of such references to different objects will be cleared.  Virtual machine
 * implementations are, however, encouraged to bias against clearing
 * recently-created or recently-used soft references.
 *
 * <h3>Avoid Soft References for Caching</h3>
 * In practice, soft references are inefficient for caching. The runtime doesn't
 * have enough information on which references to clear and which to keep. Most
 * fatally, it doesn't know what to do when given the choice between clearing a
 * soft reference and growing the heap.
 *
 * <p>The lack of information on the value to your application of each reference
 * limits the usefulness of soft references. References that are cleared too
 * early cause unnecessary work; those that are cleared too late waste memory.
 *
 * <p>Most applications should use an {@code android.util.LruCache} instead of
 * soft references. LruCache has an effective eviction policy and lets the user
 * tune how much memory is allotted.
