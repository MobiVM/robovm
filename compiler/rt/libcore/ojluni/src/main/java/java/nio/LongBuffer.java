/**
 * A long buffer.
 *
 * <p> This class defines four categories of operations upon
 * long buffers:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> Absolute and relative {@link #get() <i>get</i>} and
 *   {@link #put(long) <i>put</i>} methods that read and write
 *   single longs; </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Relative {@link #get(long[]) <i>bulk get</i>}
 *   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of longs from this buffer
 *   into an array; and</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Relative {@link #put(long[]) <i>bulk put</i>}
 *   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of longs from a
 *   long array or some other long
 *   buffer into this buffer;&#32;and </p></li>
 *
 *
 *   <li><p> Methods for {@link #compact compacting}, {@link
 *   #duplicate duplicating}, and {@link #slice slicing}
 *   a long buffer.  </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> Long buffers can be created either by {@link #allocate
 * <i>allocation</i>}, which allocates space for the buffer's
 *
 *
 * content, by {@link #wrap(long[]) <i>wrapping</i>} an existing
 * long array  into a buffer, or by creating a
 * <a href="ByteBuffer.html#views"><i>view</i></a> of an existing byte buffer.
 *
 *
*
 *
 * <p> Like a byte buffer, a long buffer is either <a
 * href="ByteBuffer.html#direct"><i>direct</i> or <i>non-direct</i></a>.  A
 * long buffer created via the <tt>wrap</tt> methods of this class will
 * be non-direct.  A long buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will
 * be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not
 * a long buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the {@link
 * #isDirect isDirect} method.  </p>
 *
*
 *
 *
 * <p> Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
 * specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows
 * method invocations to be chained.
