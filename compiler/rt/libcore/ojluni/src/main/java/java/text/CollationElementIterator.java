/**
 * The <code>CollationElementIterator</code> class is used as an iterator
 * to walk through each character of an international string. Use the iterator
 * to return the ordering priority of the positioned character. The ordering
 * priority of a character, which we refer to as a key, defines how a character
 * is collated in the given collation object.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, consider the following in Spanish:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * "ca" &rarr; the first key is key('c') and second key is key('a').
 * "cha" &rarr; the first key is key('ch') and second key is key('a').
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * And in German,
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * "\u00e4b" &rarr; the first key is key('a'), the second key is key('e'), and
 * the third key is key('b').
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * The key of a character is an integer composed of primary order(short),
 * secondary order(byte), and tertiary order(byte). Java strictly defines
 * the size and signedness of its primitive data types. Therefore, the static
 * functions <code>primaryOrder</code>, <code>secondaryOrder</code>, and
 * <code>tertiaryOrder</code> return <code>int</code>, <code>short</code>,
 * and <code>short</code> respectively to ensure the correctness of the key
 * value.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example of the iterator usage,
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *
 *  String testString = "This is a test";
 *  Collator col = Collator.getInstance();
 *  if (col instanceof RuleBasedCollator) {
 *      RuleBasedCollator ruleBasedCollator = (RuleBasedCollator)col;
 *      CollationElementIterator collationElementIterator = ruleBasedCollator.getCollationElementIterator(testString);
 *      int primaryOrder = CollationElementIterator.primaryOrder(collationElementIterator.next());
 *          :
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>CollationElementIterator.next</code> returns the collation order
 * of the next character. A collation order consists of primary order,
 * secondary order and tertiary order. The data type of the collation
 * order is <strong>int</strong>. The first 16 bits of a collation order
 * is its primary order; the next 8 bits is the secondary order and the
 * last 8 bits is the tertiary order.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> <code>CollationElementIterator</code> is a part of
 * <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> implementation. It is only usable
 * with <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> instances.
