/**
 * An engine that can transform a sequence of bytes in a specific charset into a sequence of
 * sixteen-bit Unicode characters.
 *
 * <a name="steps"></a>
 *
 * <p> The input byte sequence is provided in a byte buffer or a series
 * of such buffers.  The output character sequence is written to a character buffer
 * or a series of such buffers.  A decoder should always be used by making
 * the following sequence of method invocations, hereinafter referred to as a
 * <i>decoding operation</i>:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *   <li><p> Reset the decoder via the {@link #reset reset} method, unless it
 *   has not been used before; </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Invoke the {@link #decode decode} method zero or more times, as
 *   long as additional input may be available, passing <tt>false</tt> for the
 *   <tt>endOfInput</tt> argument and filling the input buffer and flushing the
 *   output buffer between invocations; </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Invoke the {@link #decode decode} method one final time, passing
 *   <tt>true</tt> for the <tt>endOfInput</tt> argument; and then </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Invoke the {@link #flush flush} method so that the decoder can
 *   flush any internal state to the output buffer. </p></li>
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * Each invocation of the {@link #decode decode} method will decode as many
 * bytes as possible from the input buffer, writing the resulting characters
 * to the output buffer.  The {@link #decode decode} method returns when more
 * input is required, when there is not enough room in the output buffer, or
 * when a decoding error has occurred.  In each case a {@link CoderResult}
 * object is returned to describe the reason for termination.  An invoker can
 * examine this object and fill the input buffer, flush the output buffer, or
 * attempt to recover from a decoding error, as appropriate, and try again.
 *
 * <a name="ce"></a>
 *
 * <p> There are two general types of decoding errors.  If the input byte
 * sequence is not legal for this charset then the input is considered <i>malformed</i>.  If
 * the input byte sequence is legal but cannot be mapped to a valid
 * Unicode character then an <i>unmappable character</i> has been encountered.
 *
 * <a name="cae"></a>
 *
 * <p> How a decoding error is handled depends upon the action requested for
 * that type of error, which is described by an instance of the {@link
 * CodingErrorAction} class.  The possible error actions are to {@linkplain
 * CodingErrorAction#IGNORE ignore} the erroneous input, {@linkplain
 * CodingErrorAction#REPORT report} the error to the invoker via
 * the returned {@link CoderResult} object, or {@linkplain CodingErrorAction#REPLACE
 * replace} the erroneous input with the current value of the
 * replacement string.  The replacement
 *





 * has the initial value <tt>"&#92;uFFFD"</tt>;

 *
 * its value may be changed via the {@link #replaceWith(java.lang.String)
 * replaceWith} method.
 *
 * <p> The default action for malformed-input and unmappable-character errors
 * is to {@linkplain CodingErrorAction#REPORT report} them.  The
 * malformed-input error action may be changed via the {@link
 * #onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction) onMalformedInput} method; the
 * unmappable-character action may be changed via the {@link
 * #onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction) onUnmappableCharacter} method.
 *
 * <p> This class is designed to handle many of the details of the decoding
 * process, including the implementation of error actions.  A decoder for a
 * specific charset, which is a concrete subclass of this class, need only
 * implement the abstract {@link #decodeLoop decodeLoop} method, which
 * encapsulates the basic decoding loop.  A subclass that maintains internal
 * state should, additionally, override the {@link #implFlush implFlush} and
 * {@link #implReset implReset} methods.
 *
 * <p> Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
 * threads.  </p>

     *   insufficient space in the output buffer to decode any more bytes.
     *   This method should be invoked again with an output buffer that has
     *   more {@linkplain Buffer#remaining remaining} characters. This is
     *   typically done by draining any decoded characters from the output
     *   buffer.  </p></li>
     *
     *   <li><p> A {@linkplain CoderResult#malformedForLength
     *   malformed-input} result indicates that a malformed-input
     *   error has been detected.  The malformed bytes begin at the input
     *   buffer's (possibly incremented) position; the number of malformed
     *   bytes may be determined by invoking the result object's {@link
     *   CoderResult#length() length} method.  This case applies only if the
     *   {@linkplain #onMalformedInput malformed action} of this decoder
     *   is {@link CodingErrorAction#REPORT}; otherwise the malformed input

     *   <li><p> An {@linkplain CoderResult#unmappableForLength
     *   unmappable-character} result indicates that an
     *   unmappable-character error has been detected.  The bytes that
     *   decode the unmappable character begin at the input buffer's (possibly
     *   incremented) position; the number of such bytes may be determined
     *   by invoking the result object's {@link CoderResult#length() length}
     *   method.  This case applies only if the {@linkplain #onUnmappableCharacter
     *   unmappable action} of this decoder is {@link
     *   CodingErrorAction#REPORT}; otherwise the unmappable character will be
     *   ignored or replaced, as requested.  </p></li>
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * In any case, if this method is to be reinvoked in the same decoding
     * operation then care should be taken to preserve any bytes remaining
     * in the input buffer so that they are available to the next invocation.
     *
     * <p> The <tt>endOfInput</tt> parameter advises this method as to whether
     * the invoker can provide further input beyond that contained in the given
     * input buffer.  If there is a possibility of providing additional input
     * then the invoker should pass <tt>false</tt> for this parameter; if there
     * is no possibility of providing further input then the invoker should
     * pass <tt>true</tt>.  It is not erroneous, and in fact it is quite
     * common, to pass <tt>false</tt> in one invocation and later discover that
     * no further input was actually available.  It is critical, however, that
     * the final invocation of this method in a sequence of invocations always
     * pass <tt>true</tt> so that any remaining undecoded input will be treated
     * as being malformed.
