/**
 * CloseGuard is a mechanism for flagging implicit finalizer cleanup of
 * resources that should have been cleaned up by explicit close
 * methods (aka "explicit termination methods" in Effective Java).
 * <p>
 * A simple example: <pre>   {@code
 *   class Foo {
 *
 *       {@literal @}ReachabilitySensitive
 *       private final CloseGuard guard = CloseGuard.get();
 *
 *       ...
 *
 *       public Foo() {
 *           ...;
 *           guard.open("cleanup");
 *       }
 *
 *       public void cleanup() {
 *          guard.close();
 *          ...;
 *       }
 *
 *       protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
 *           try {
 *               // Note that guard could be null if the constructor threw.
 *               if (guard != null) {
 *                   guard.warnIfOpen();
 *               }
 *               cleanup();
 *           } finally {
 *               super.finalize();
 *           }
 *       }
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * In usage where the resource to be explicitly cleaned up is
 * allocated after object construction, CloseGuard protection can
 * be deferred. For example: <pre>   {@code
 *   class Bar {
 *
 *       {@literal @}ReachabilitySensitive
 *       private final CloseGuard guard = CloseGuard.get();
 *
 *       ...
 *
 *       public Bar() {
 *           ...;
 *       }
 *
 *       public void connect() {
 *          ...;
 *          guard.open("cleanup");
 *       }
 *
 *       public void cleanup() {
 *          guard.close();
 *          ...;
 *       }
 *
 *       protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
 *           try {
 *               // Note that guard could be null if the constructor threw.
 *               if (guard != null) {
 *                   guard.warnIfOpen();
 *               }
 *               cleanup();
 *           } finally {
 *               super.finalize();
 *           }
 *       }
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * When used in a constructor, calls to {@code open} should occur at
 * the end of the constructor since an exception that would cause
 * abrupt termination of the constructor will mean that the user will
 * not have a reference to the object to cleanup explicitly. When used
 * in a method, the call to {@code open} should occur just after
 * resource acquisition.
 *
 * The @ReachabilitySensitive annotation ensures that finalize() cannot be
 * called during the explicit call to cleanup(), prior to the guard.close call.
 * There is an extremely small chance that, for code that neglects to call
 * cleanup(), finalize() and thus cleanup() will be called while a method on
 * the object is still active, but the "this" reference is no longer required.
 * If missing cleanup() calls are expected, additional @ReachabilitySensitive
 * annotations or reachabilityFence() calls may be required.
