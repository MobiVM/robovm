Reports classes that implements <code>NSObjectProtocol</code> and doesn't extend from NSObject

Objc/Bro code will not be able to marshal such pure Java object to ObjC/Native side.
(and will crash with message: <code>CLASSNAME cannot be cast to org.robovm.objc.ObjCObject</code>)
While there is Object to NSObject promoter plugin that will replace super with NSObject
during RoboVM compilation phase, it's always better to have it clearly specified in source code.
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
    // will be reported as warning with option to extend from NSObject
    class Foo implements NSObjectProtocol {}

    // will be reported as error as Foo doesn't extend from java.lang.Object directly
    class Foo extends ArrayList implements NSObjectProtocol {}
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    This inspection is intended for RoboVM application that use ObjC bindings.
